## Task 1: Basic Linear Regression  

### What I Learned:  
- Implemented a simple *linear regression model* using a single predictor.  
- Understood how to make *predictions* and evaluate the model using *R-squared* as a performance metric.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Ensuring the dataset was well-prepared for regression analysis.  
- Interpreting the R-squared value in different scenarios.  

## Task 2: Data Visualization for Regression  

### What I Learned:  
- Plotted *data points* and the *regression line* to visually interpret the relationship.  
- Understood the importance of visualization in understanding model fit.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Choosing the right visualization techniques for better clarity.  
- Adjusting the scale and labels to make the plot more insightful.  

## Task 3: Multiple Linear Regression  

### What I Learned:  
- Implemented a *multiple linear regression model* with multiple features.  
- Analyzed how using multiple predictors improves prediction accuracy.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Handling multicollinearity among features.  
- Understanding the impact of each feature on the target variable.  

## Task 4: Model Assessment  

### What I Learned:  
- Calculated and interpreted *R-squared* and *RMSE* for evaluating model performance.  
- Understood the difference between *goodness-of-fit* and *prediction error*.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Understanding the trade-off between R-squared and RMSE.  
- Interpreting RMSE in relation to the datasetâ€™s scale.  

## Task 5: Feature Impact Analysis  

### What I Learned:  
- Analyzed how different *features contribute* to model predictions.  
- Explored *coefficient values* and their significance in regression models.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Interpreting feature importance when variables were correlated.  
- Understanding when feature scaling is necessary.  

## Task 6: Polynomial Regression  

### What I Learned:  
- Implemented *polynomial regression* to capture non-linear relationships.  
- Compared the performance of *linear vs polynomial models* using visualization.  

### Challenges Faced:  
- Choosing the right polynomial degree to avoid overfitting.  
- Understanding the computational cost of higher-degree models.
